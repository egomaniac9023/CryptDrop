        <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
        <p>At CryptDrop, we are dedicated to protecting your privacy. This service was built with privacy as its core principle.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p>We collect absolutely minimal data to provide our service:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Message Content</strong>: Your message content is encrypted in your browser before being sent to our servers. We never receive the unencrypted content.</li>
          <li><strong>Encryption Keys</strong>: Encryption keys are generated in your browser and are never transmitted to our servers. Keys are only shared in the URL fragment (#) which is not sent to the server.</li>
          <li><strong>Attachments</strong>: Any file attachments are encrypted client-side and we never have access to the unencrypted content.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>We only store:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The encrypted message</li>
          <li>A unique ID for the message</li>
          <li>Creation timestamp</li>
          <li>Encrypted file attachments (if any)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data is permanently deleted from our servers after:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The message is viewed once, or</li>
          <li>24 hours from creation, whichever comes first</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>Secure Deletion</h2>
        <p>When a note is deleted (after viewing or expiration), we employ forensic countermeasures to ensure it cannot be recovered:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple-pass overwriting of data before deletion</li>
          <li>Database vacuuming to prevent forensic recovery</li>
          <li>Zero-knowledge server architecture</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>IP Addresses and Logs</h2>
        <p>For security purposes, we implement rate limiting to prevent service abuse. This requires temporary retention of IP addresses, which are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Never associated with message content</li>
          <li>Not logged persistently</li>
          <li>Only kept in memory for the duration of rate limiting windows (max 1 hour)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>No Third Party Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any data with third parties. Period.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="policy-section">
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We employ multiple layers of security:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side AES-256 encryption</li>
          <li>HTTPS for all connections</li>
          <li>XSS and other vulnerability protections</li>
          <li>Secure HTTP headers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We cannot access your message content even if legally compelled to do so, as we never possess the encryption keys.</p>
